# Automated Clustering of High-dimensional Data with a Feature Weighted Mean Shift Algorithm

This repository implement clustering algorithem [Feature Weighted Mean Shift Algorithm](https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AAAI-2608.ChakrabortyS.pdf)


## Environment

`conda create -n env python=3.9`

`conda activate env`


`conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn`

`conda install -c anaconda scipy`

`conda install -c anaconda seaborn`

`conda install pandas`

`conda install pandas`

`pip install pyclustering`

Also make sure that `Rscript.exe` is in your path.

Code was tasted only on windows 10.

## Results

Jupyter notebook `simulation.ipynb` contains demos and experiments.
